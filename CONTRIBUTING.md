Welcome to rUNSWift
===================

Firstly, we hope you completed [Getting Started](../../wiki/Getting-Started) successfully.

* If so, please create a [GitHub Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) with your public SSH key.
* If not please join us on the [rUNSWift Slack](https://runswift.slack.com) and ask in `#help` for help.

That's basically it - we use [GitHub issues](../../issues) to discuss how we might solve problems, and [PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to get at least two sets of eyes on all non-trivial changes. 

We use branches as opposed to forks for managing our codebase, to have everything that the team is working on available to all of the team members.

The RoboCup SPL is a software competition, meaning it's about working as a team to read and write the best code. We hope to see you contributing soon!
